# basic_crypto_scrapping

On my quest to learn Apache Airflow and ETL pipelines, I've create a simple DAG to scrap data from https://coinmarketcap.com. 

1. Setup a coins watchlist url to keep the data consistent
2. Use Selenium to scrap and estract the data
3. Transform the coins data to comply with my database table setup
4. Load the data to my local MySQLDB

Had it running for about 24hrs and got about 820 records, that I may use to practice D3.js
